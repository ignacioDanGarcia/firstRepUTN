## 13 exercise. 
#### btw clearly unfinished

The Kokumo(?) Technologies laboratory is developing the prototype of an explorer robot whose
Traction system can be customized to better suit the terrain.
The robot, called KT-2020, has the following characteristics:

● Serial number: KT-2020-P

● Base Traction Power (PTB): 10 hp

● Traction: any of the two options developed.
~~~~~
The traction systems available are:

● Rubber wheel: ideal for urban environments, its use subtracts 1 hp from the PTB and allows the
rolled up to 100 km; when it wears out, it must be replaced.

● There´s another but I didn´t implement or even code it :)
